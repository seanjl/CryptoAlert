# CryptoAlert
Simple Python script which alerts the user when a cryptocurrencies goes above or below a user set price and advises them whether to hold/buy/sell

All you have to do is get your free API key from http://nomics.com/ and set the currency/crypto and the highPriceAlert/lowPriceAlert that you want (default is EUR/ETH, 2600/1600).

If the price goes below the lowPriceAlert, the script will tell you to buy.
If the price goes above the highPriceAlert, the script will tell you to sell.
If it stays withing the range, it will tell you to hold.

Obviously it's a very simple/dumb script and you shouldn't trust your life savings in it, since crypto markets are highly volatile.
